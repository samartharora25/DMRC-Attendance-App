# 🛡️ DMRC Facial Recognition Attendance System

A mobile-based attendance system developed for **Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)** employees, using **facial recognition** and **geofencing** to enable secure, contactless, and location-verified check-ins.

Built with **Flutter** on the frontend, **Flask (Python)** on the backend, and **local JSON + image storage** for lightweight deployment without any cloud dependency.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ On-device facial recognition using employee face data  
- ✅ Real-time attendance logging with timestamps  
- ✅ Geofencing: ensures check-ins only within authorized DMRC premises  
- ✅ Local storage: no cloud required, all data is stored in a local folder  
- ✅ Admin-ready backend to view logs or integrate a dashboard

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Registration Phase**  
   - Admin registers an employee via Flutter app by uploading name, employee ID, and a face image.  
   - Image is saved to `/faces/` directory and encoding is stored in `data.json`.

2. **Recognition Phase**  
   - Employee opens the app and scans their face.  
   - The app sends the image to the Flask backend.  
   - The backend compares the scanned face to known encodings and verifies identity.  
   - If successful, attendance is logged with the current timestamp.

3. **Geofencing**  
   - GPS coordinates are checked before allowing attendance.  
   - Ensures attendance can only be marked inside DMRC premises.
